Step 1: Create a new Spring Boot project

Using your preferred IDE or build tool, create a new Spring Boot project. For this example, we'll use Spring Initializr to create a new project.

Step 2: Define entity classes

Create entity classes for Game, Player, Question, and QuestionBank. Annotate these classes with @Entity and define their attributes and relationships according to the class diagrams.

Step 3: Create repository interfaces

Create repository interfaces for each entity using Spring Data JPA. These interfaces will extend JpaRepository and provide methods for CRUD operations.

Step 4: Implement service classes

Implement service classes to encapsulate business logic. For example, a GameService class can handle game-related operations such as starting a game, adding players, presenting questions, and updating scores.

Step 5: Create controller classes

Create controller classes to handle incoming HTTP requests and interact with the service layer. Define endpoints for starting and ending the game, adding players, answering questions, and other use cases.

Step 6: Define DTOs

Define DTO classes to represent data transferred between the client and the server. These DTOs can be used to format data for request and response bodies.

Step 7: Implement security configuration (optional)

Implement security configurations if your application requires authentication and authorization.

Step 8: Write unit tests

Write unit tests for your service and controller classes to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use frameworks like JUnit and Mockito for testing.

Step 9: Run and test

Run your Spring Boot application and test the endpoints using tools like Postman or Swagger UI.

Step 10: Document and Swagger (optional)

Document your APIs using Swagger or Spring REST Docs to provide a clear overview of the endpoints and their functionalities.

This is a basic outline of how to create a Spring Boot project based on the provided class diagrams and use cases. You can customize and extend this project as needed to fit your specific requirements.
